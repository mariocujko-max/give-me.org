    <h1>Help Homeless People Directly – Private Donations That Matter</h1>

    <p>
        Many people live on the streets and struggle every day to survive.
        They sleep outside, lack basic necessities, and are often ignored by society.
    </p>

    <p>
        This page exists to <strong>help homeless people directly</strong>
        through private donations, without organizations or bureaucracy.
    </p>

    <p>
        I run this project as a <strong>private individual</strong>.
        The goal is simple: <strong>human help for people in need</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Why direct help is important</h2>

    <p>
        Homeless people often need immediate support, not complicated systems.
        Direct help can make a real difference in their daily lives.
    </p>

    <p>
        Donations help provide:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>food and drinks</li>
        <li>warm clothing</li>
        <li>basic hygiene items</li>
        <li>small direct financial help</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Sometimes, small support can mean safety, dignity, and hope.
    </p>

    <h2>How donations are used</h2>

    <p>
        Donations collected on this page are used to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>buy meals and drinks</li>
        <li>provide warm clothing</li>
        <li>offer direct support in urgent situations</li>
        <li>help people on the street personally</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Help is given <strong>directly and respectfully</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Private and personal support</h2>

    <p>
        This is not a charity organization.
        I help as a <strong>private person</strong> because I believe in personal responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
        This allows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>fast help</li>
        <li>direct support</li>
        <li>honest intentions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Respect and dignity</h2>

    <p>
        Helping homeless people is not about judgment.
        It is about respect, dignity, and compassion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every person deserves basic human care.
    </p>

    <h2>Every donation helps</h2>

    <p>
        You do not need to donate a lot to help.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even small donations can:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>buy a warm meal</li>
        <li>provide clean clothing</li>
        <li>make a difficult day easier</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Every contribution matters.
    </p>

    <h2>Transparency and trust</h2>

    <p>
        I try to share:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>how donations are used</li>
        <li>when help is provided</li>
        <li>what support was possible</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Trust and honesty are the foundation of this project.
    </p>
