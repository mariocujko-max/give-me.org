    <h1>Donate to Support Animal Shelters – Help Where It’s Needed Most</h1>

    <p>
        Animal shelters do incredibly important work every day.
        They rescue abandoned, injured, and neglected animals and give them a safe place to stay.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many shelters struggle financially and depend heavily on donations.
        This page exists to <strong>support animal shelters through private donations</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project is run by a <strong>private individual</strong>.
        Donations are used <strong>directly to help animal shelters</strong>, without organizations or bureaucracy.
    </p>

    <h2>Why animal shelters need support</h2>

    <p>
        Animal shelters care for many animals at the same time.
        They face high costs every month.
    </p>

    <p>
        Shelters must pay for:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>food and water</li>
        <li>veterinary care and medication</li>
        <li>emergency treatments</li>
        <li>basic supplies and maintenance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Without enough support, shelters may be forced to reduce their work or turn animals away.
    </p>

    <h2>How your donation helps shelters</h2>

    <p>
        Donations collected on this page are used to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>buy food for animals in shelters</li>
        <li>support medical treatments and vet bills</li>
        <li>help with urgent shelter needs</li>
        <li>provide basic supplies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The goal is to help shelters continue their mission of saving animals.
    </p>

    <h2>Private and direct support</h2>

    <p>
        This is a <strong>private donation project</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        That means:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>no administrative costs</li>
        <li>no paid staff</li>
        <li>no hidden fees</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Your donation goes <strong>directly toward helping animal shelters</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Helping shelters helps many animals</h2>

    <p>
        By supporting a shelter, you help not just one animal, but many.
        Shelters provide safety, care, and hope for animals that have nowhere else to go.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every supported shelter means:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>animals are fed</li>
        <li>animals receive medical care</li>
        <li>animals get a second chance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Small donations make a big difference</h2>

    <p>
        Animal shelters need continuous support.
        Even small donations can help cover daily costs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every contribution helps keep shelters running and animals safe.
    </p>

    <h2>Transparency and trust</h2>

    <p>
        I aim to be transparent by sharing:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>how donations are used</li>
        <li>which shelters are supported</li>
        <li>what kind of help was possible</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Honesty and trust are the foundation of this project.
    </p>
