    <h1>Donate for Animal Surgery – Help Animals Get Medical Care</h1>

    <p>
        Many animals suffer from serious injuries or illnesses.
        Often, the only chance to survive is an <strong>urgent and expensive surgery</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, animal surgeries are costly, and many people or animal shelters
        <strong>cannot afford the necessary medical treatment</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This page exists to collect donations to <strong>help animals receive life-saving surgeries</strong>
        and essential medical care.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project is run by a <strong>private person</strong>, not an organization.
        Donations are used <strong>directly to support animal surgeries</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Why animal surgeries need support</h2>

    <p>
        Veterinary medicine has advanced greatly, but medical care has become expensive.
        Even simple procedures can cost hundreds of euros.
    </p>

    <p>
        Animals may need surgery because of:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>accidents or injuries</li>
        <li>broken bones</li>
        <li>infections or internal problems</li>
        <li>tumors or growths</li>
        <li>congenital conditions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Without help, many animals would be left untreated and continue to suffer.
    </p>

    <h2>How your donation is used</h2>

    <p>
        Donations collected on this page are used to:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>support urgent animal surgeries</li>
        <li>help pay veterinary bills</li>
        <li>assist animal shelters with medical expenses</li>
        <li>help private individuals save their animals</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The goal is simple: <strong>reduce suffering and save lives</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Private and honest help</h2>

    <p>
        This is a <strong>private donation project</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        That means:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>no administrative costs</li>
        <li>no salaries</li>
        <li>no profit</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Every donation goes <strong>directly toward animal medical care</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Every animal deserves a chance</h2>

    <p>
        Animals cannot decide for themselves.
        They depend on humans to care for them when they are injured or sick.
    </p>

    <p>
        With your support:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>animals can receive life-saving surgery</li>
        <li>pain and suffering can be reduced</li>
        <li>animals can recover and live better lives</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Even small donations help</h2>

    <p>
        Medical treatment can be expensive, but many small donations together
        can make a big difference.
    </p>

    <p>
        No donation is too small to help an animal in need.
    </p>

    <h2>Transparency and trust</h2>

    <p>
        I try to be as transparent as possible by sharing:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>how donations are used</li>
        <li>when surgeries are supported</li>
        <li>what kind of help was possible</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This project is based on <strong>trust, honesty, and compassion</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Help animals get medical care</h2>

    <p>
        If you want to <strong>donate for animal surgery</strong> and help animals receive
        the medical treatment they need, your support is greatly appreciated.
